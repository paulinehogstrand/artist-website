        <p><b>Pauline Hogstrand</b> is a Swedish viola player and composer, based in Copenhagen since 2009. Her solo works implement composed structures in cyclic and extended forms for varied instrumentations ranging from strings, recorder, pipes, percussive instruments and synthesis, in electroacoustic and acoustic formats. Hogstrand’s music is rich within the use of harmonic and rhythmic texture in suggestive dynamic motions. Her compositions explore the inherent spectral properties of sound and their ability to transcend time and space, body and unitary. In 2020 Pauline Hogstrand released her debut solo album <i>The Enterer</i>, in collaboration with the Copenhagen based labels No Technique and Forlaget Kornmod. Her second album <i>Áhkká</i> was released in 2023 at Warm Winters Ltd. and has been received critically acclaimed.
