        <p><b>Pauline Hogstrand</b> is a composer, violist, and performer whose work moves fluidly between acoustic, electroacoustic, and collective formats. Rooted in classical training and experimental practice, her music unfolds in patiently evolving forms—where intimate noise, detailed textures, and organised chaos coexist with structural clarity.
</p>
<p>Often working in longform compositions and performative settings, Hogstrand crafts precise musical narratives that draw on improvisation, sensorial playfulness, and a poetic yet objective approach to sound. Her scores are open but intentional, inviting performers into finely balanced worlds of sensitivity and rigour. There’s a sense of unsentimental nostalgia in her work—moments that briefly illuminate, evoking a fleeting presence that resists being held.
</p>
<p>Originally from Piteå in northern Sweden and now based in Copenhagen, she is active both as a solo artist and in collaborative constellations including Damkapellet, Crush String Collective, Blue Lake, and E/I. Her recent compositions have been commissioned by Koncertkirken, Huset i Aalborg, Momentum Musik, and Musikhuset København, among others.
</p>
<p>Hogstrand holds a master’s degree in viola from the Royal Danish Academy of Music and has studied electroacoustic composition at Malmö Academy of Music. Her discography includes Áhkká, The Enterer, and Chants, as well as collaborative releases with Damkapellet, Crush String Collective, and Blue Lake.
</p>
<p>She is a member of the Danish Composers’ Society (DKF) and Danish Society for Music Rights (KODA), and a certified coach through Karin Boucher’s The Big Picture (SE). Her work has been supported by Statens Kunstfond, Carl Nielsen and Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen’s Talent Prize, KODA, and several other institutions.
